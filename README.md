# MNIST Digit Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and optimize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The MNIST dataset is a classic benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision.

## Project Overview

### Goals
1. Build a CNN model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
2. Train the model on the training dataset and validate its performance on the validation dataset.
3. Optimize the model's performance using hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation.
4. Evaluate the model on the test dataset and visualize the results.

### Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 28x28 pixels. The dataset is split into:
- **Training set**: 60,000 images
- **Test set**: 10,000 images

## Steps and Methodology

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

- **Data Loading**: The MNIST dataset is loaded using TensorFlow's Keras API.
- **Normalization**: Pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1] to facilitate faster and more stable training.
- **Reshaping**: Images are reshaped to include the channel dimension (28, 28, 1) to make them compatible with the CNN input requirements.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Labels are converted to one-hot encoded format to prepare them for classification.

### 2. Model Building

- **Architecture**: The CNN model consists of three convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, a flatten layer, a dense layer, and a dropout layer for regularization.
- **Activation Function**: ReLU is used for the convolutional and dense layers to introduce non-linearity, and softmax is used for the output layer to produce probability distributions over the classes.

### 3. Model Compilation

- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer is used for its efficiency and adaptive learning rate capabilities, which helps in faster convergence.
- **Loss Function**: Sparse categorical cross-entropy is used for multi-class classification tasks.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy is used as the evaluation metric to monitor the model's performance.

### 4. Model Training

- **Epochs**: The model is trained for 20 epochs to allow sufficient learning iterations.
- **Batch Size**: A batch size of 64 is chosen to balance memory usage and training speed.
- **Validation Split**: 20% of the training data is used for validation to monitor the model's performance during training and prevent overfitting.

### 5. Model Evaluation

- **Test Accuracy**: The model is evaluated on the test dataset to measure its generalization performance.
- **Test Loss**: The test loss is also calculated to understand the model's performance.

### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning

- **Keras Tuner**: Hyperparameter tuning is performed using Keras Tuner to find the optimal configuration for the model.
- **Best Hyperparameters**: The optimal number of filters, dense units, dropout rate, and learning rate are identified through the tuning process.

### 7. Results and Visualization

- **Test Accuracy**: Achieved a test accuracy of approximately 99.24%, demonstrating excellent generalization.
- **Test Loss**: Achieved a test loss of 0.0332, indicating a good fit on the test data.
- **Visualization**: Visualized some test images along with their predicted and true labels to qualitatively assess the model's performance.

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates how to build, train, and optimize a CNN for digit classification using the MNIST dataset. The model achieved high accuracy and generalizes well to the test data. Hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation were employed to further enhance the model's performance.
